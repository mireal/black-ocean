                    This Risk Management Policy forms part of Black Ocean s.r.o.’s
                    governance and control arrangements.

                  <Box>
                    Risk management is not an isolated activity. It is one element
                    together with planning, project and performance management of
                    effective governance and management. The focus is on those
                    risks that could disrupt the achievement of Black Ocean
                    s.r.o.'s strategy.
                  </Box>
                  <Box>
                    The purpose of this policy and the supporting guidance is to
                    establish Black Ocean s.r.o.’s underlying approach to risk
                    management by clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the
                    Board of Directors, the Finance and Audit Committee, Senior
                    Management and other staff. It also describes the context for
                    risk management as part of the overall system of internal
                    controls and arrangements for periodic review. It aims to
                    support those staff with particular involvement in
                    anticipating, assessing and managing risks so that they can
                    take timely and well-founded risk-informed decisions.

                    A risk is commonly defined as an effect of uncertainty on the
                    achievement of objectives. In other words, risks are various
                    events that can affect the achievement of objectives. Risk can
                    have both negative and positive outcomes. Our aim is to manage
                    the adverse effects and turn the risk into value. Risks are an
                    everyday part of our activities. Our operations involve
                    multiple partnerships, challenging environmental,
                    organizational contexts and extensive geographic scope. The
                    realization of our mission and strategy depends on our ability
                    to recognise risks and to define suitable measures for their
                    treatment. Effective risk management is about effective
                    decision- making, not compliance. It is not limited to the
                    identification and mitigation of negative risks, but also
                    enables opportunities to be recognised that may involve some
                    level of risk where they also have the potential to lead to
                    positive outcomes, supporting the overall strategy.

                    Risk management refers to all activities performed by Black
                    Ocean s.r.o. to anticipate, identify, assess and control the
                    uncertainties which may impact on Black Ocean s.r.o.'s ability
                    to achieve its aims, objectives and opportunities. These will
                    range from organization-wide to specific projects or
                    programmes, to the individual.
                  </Box>
                  <Box>
                    The risk management policy aims to demonstrate that Black
                    Ocean s.r.o. is acting appropriately to anticipate risks; to
                    assess risks; to avoid excessive risk; to embrace necessary or
                    desirable risks with appropriate safeguards; that its response
                    to risk, whether by insurance, control measures or avoidance,
                    is proportionate and effective; that responsible staff are
                    equipped to take risk-based decisions with confidence; and
                    that we are intelligent in applying our risk appetite.

                    In our work to achieve our ambition, four risks stand out. The
                    first concerns our reputation. Our Mission centers on creating
                    and sharing knowledge and delivering projects that have a real
                    impact. So we must undertake research and knowledge work of
                    the highest quality and secure maximum impact and influence
                    for our activities. As such, our reputation for the quality of
                    our work, our autonomy and ethical and intellectual integrity
                    are of paramount importance. We will be bold in the nature of
                    our work, in our technical thinking, in our methodologies and
                    we will be innovative in how we seek to impact and influence.
                    We will do everything we can to mitigate risks to our
                    reputation.
                  </Box>
                  <Box>
                    The second concerns our people. Certain parts of our work
                    takes place online and overseas in locations that are
                    inherently risky. We are responsible for the well-being of our
                    staff. We, therefore, seek to ensure that work with partners
                    overseas and in particular, overseas travel for our own staff,
                    is informed by robust risk assessments and that traveling
                    staff are trained and supported in their individual journeys.
                    We will not require staff to travel or work in areas where we
                    assess the risks to be excessive.
                  </Box>
                  <Box>
                    The third concerns our financial position. We will manage our
                    income and control our costs, remain competitive whilst
                    delivering well-managed projects and programmes on time and on
                    budget. We will seek to minimize our financial exposure. We
                    will not compromise our ethical standards to secure funding.
                    We will not undertake work that compromises our financial
                    solvency.
                  </Box>
                  <Box>
                    The fourth concerns the impact of our projects and programmes.
                    Many of our services involve partners and collaborators often
                    based online and overseas and/or operating in challenging
                    environments. To do this well, we need to anticipate and
                    manage all project and programme risks at the pre-proposal,
                    proposal and inception stages. We need to make decisions about
                    when to bid for funding and with whom, in good time but often
                    on the basis of imperfect information. We need to be prepared
                    to decide when we will take well-judged risks. when we will
                    support responsible risk-taking and when we will not submit a
                    funding proposal because of the risks. When we do, we must use
                    relevant management information to track progress and identify
                    difficulties. We will support our staff to do this well. We
                    will not undertake work where we assess the financial or
                    delivery risks to be too high. We will not compromise our
                    ethical standards in delivering our work.

                    Effective risk management requires risks to be anticipated,
                    identified and assessed regularly, and actions are taken to
                    manage the risks, whether these are positive or negative. To
                    support risk assessment and actions to be identified, Black
                    Ocean s.r.o. will develop documentation about each
                    project/programme specifying the country of operation, partner
                    exposure, any key risks (e.g. foreign exchange). It will also
                    develop training and communications tools to support project
                    managers to manage risk.

                      by the activities of our partners. We will, therefore,
                      select our partners carefully and we will develop a set of

                    Our approach to risk management reflects sector guidance and

                Risks regarded as high or very high in impact and probability

                either realize the potential benefits or avoid the potential

                bidding and throughout their funded life. Different risks will be
                managed with a particular focus. Some will be addressed through

                    Internal controls encompass a review of the risks inherent in
                    each activity. The Finance and Audit Committee report to the
                    Board on the adequacy of internal controls. As part of its
                    remit, the Committee reviews the work of the Internal and
                    External Auditors and of Black Ocean s.r.o.'s management. The
                    Committee is therefore well placed to advise the Board on the
                    effectiveness of the internal control system.

                        of the possible/likely “upsides” although the idea of
                        focusing resources on the most risky can apply to risks to
                        be embraced as well as to those to be managed/mitigated.
